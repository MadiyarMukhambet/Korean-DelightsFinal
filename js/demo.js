The seasoning blend typically includes fiery red pepper powder, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, and sometimes chicken flavoring. Itâ€™s often paired with sesame seeds and dried seaweed flakes as garnishes. These noodles are stir-fried rather than served as a soup, creating a rich, sticky sauce that clings to the noodles. The name Buldak translates to fire chicken reflecting the dish's extreme spiciness and the inspiration behind its flavor profile.",
